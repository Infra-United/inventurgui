# inventurgui
Just testing if you can create a simple gui for an excel sheet quickly

## Features
### Data Handling
- reads data from an ods file
- creates a pandas DataFrame
- drops unnecessary Entries and Columns
### NiceGUI
- creates Tabs for each category (unique value in the first Column)
- creates AGGrids under each Tab with the Data in that category
- makes filtering available
- option to toggle available filter options in the second column

## Roadmap
- add more Tabs with other data sheets
- make selections visible in another tab
- add option to edit the number
- add option to send a mail with the list or something similar
